# Building a Lyrics-based Genre Classifier using fastai

In this project I build a neural net to classify songs into one of three genres based on their lyrics. The lyrics are obtained via the lyricsgenius package and the model is built with the powerful fastai library.

A post describing this project can also be found on my [Blog](https://tlary.github.io/post/genreclassifier/).
